For the full year of their marriage, he had never once cared for his wife.

Except for the fact that the woman was ugly as sin, he knew nothing else about her.

One day, he couldn’t stand it anymore and suggested a divorce.

### *My Sassy President* Trailer

“President of LK Corporation Mu Haoyu caught in a romantic affair with young debuting model Huang Mina. Photos of their intimate moments were captured while they spent a sweet night on a 300million yatch…”

Social media were bombarded with this explosive news and gossips were spreading like wild fire in A city.

A young lady sat silently on a Cambridge settee. She was wearing an ash blue uniform and her hair in a pleasant French twist. There was just something captivating about her eyes, one would say it is as dreamy as the sunset yet as serene as the morning dew. Even her still expression was mesmerising.

The exquisite young lady remained emotionless learning of this news.

The housemaid, Mrs Lee stood beside anxiously, greatly concern with the lady’s afterthought.

“They have been married over a year. Yet the young master was never home. And oh dear! All these scandals from time to time…” Mrs Lee thought to herself, she just couldn’t help but worry.

“Young lady, it must be those wicked paparazzi, please don’t trust sources like this…” Mrs Lee tried her best to console the young lady.

At once, the call was picked up.

“Are you coming home tonight? I wish to speak to you.” Yaxin replied.

“Spill it through the call. I absolutely, truly, genuinely do not want to see your face. It makes me sick.” Mu Haoyu said. His harsh words were insolent and purposeful.

Recalling Yaxin’s appearance that day made his skin crawl.

Upon his unmannered words, Yaxin tightened her grip, “But we are married!” She said. Her tone suggested a simmering vexation.

“Xia Yaxin! Be warned. Do not spew the marriage nonsense to me, this is all just a sham! Just thinking of your looks makes me sick. How I wish to divorce you!” Mu yelled furiously.

A divorce?

“Mu Haoyu, throughout this marriage I have been faithful and up to mark. Nor did I ever wrong you. What in the world are your excuses to divorce me!?” Yaxin retaliated in rage.
