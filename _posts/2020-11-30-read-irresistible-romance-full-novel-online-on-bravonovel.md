### *Irresistible Romance* novel preview

It was 10 p.m. when Yan Wen drunkenly dragged her tired body back to the apartment. Since she was getting married the next day, she had celebrated the end of singleness with some friends but had a bit too much to drink.

Yan Wen was slumped on the sofa with her eyes closed, when she heard some strange noises coming from the bathroom. It sounded like a couple's heavy breathing. She fumbled over to investigate, leaning on the wall when suddenly a woman's voice rang out, "Faster… Faster!"

Shameful thumping sounds pierced her eardrums, and then abruptly stopped. Her blood ran cold as the only sound left was the man's heavy breathing.

"Don't wake Yan Wen up. Get dressed and I'll send you home." The man whispered hoarsely.

"Oh, are you scared she'll find out about us? Don't worry, she drank too much tonight... You might be marrying her tomorrow, but tonight, you're all mine!"

Jiang Lingyun pursed her lips in disapproval and out of the corner of her eye, spotted the indistinct silhouette through the shower door. She smirked and laughed. Yan Wen, isn't it about time you gave up? This way, the child I'm carrying can officially be recognized!

Outside the bathroom, Yan Wen held back her tears and staggered backwards. Leaning on the wall for support, she clenched the fists hanging by her sides as the blood drained from her face.

She had given up a starring role to Jiang Lingyun for this man. She had put all her effort and resources into promoting Jiang Lingyun for this man.

But they... had already been hooking up!

The battle continued in the bathroom for a long time before finally quieting. Yan Wen lay back on the sofa silently, restraining the roiling pain in her heart.

After a while, Jiang Lingyun left the apartment on the elbow of the man.

Hiding behind the curtains, Yan Wen watched as they got in the car together. Her heart felt like it was going to shatter and her eyes swam with tears.

He had promised to go to the Marriage Registration Office with her! What was he going to do about that!

Her heart was filled with desolation and betrayal. Angry and yet still hurting, Yan Wen had a sleepless night. The next day, wanting to know what Bai Zhexuan had to say for himself, she got a car to the Marriage Registration Office as previously agreed.

The appointment time came but Bai Zhexuan did not show up.

Yan Wen waited in the corridor for another hour before she finally received a phone call.

"Wen, Jiang Lingyun injured herself while she was helping you train the rookie. I need to head there now. Regarding the registration, let's do it another day!!"

Huh…… He said it so casually.
