### Billionaire God of War novel Introduction:

Fifteen years ago, Jiang Ning was thrown out from one of the country's wealthiest families, roaming the streets after his mother passed away from an illness. At his lowest point, he met a kind girl, Lin Yuzhen, who gave him a sweet. She told him that as long as he ate this sweet, his life would get sweeter and sweeter. After that, Jiang Ning was taken away by a mysterious person and went through grueling training and fights! Fifteen years later, he had risen to become the ultimate God of War in the East, with incomparable wealth and power. He has returned as a king! But her father's legs had been crippled in a car accident, and her mother was weak and gentle. Growing up in a family that favored boys over girls and infighting over the family's assets, the family eventually found a man to marry into her family by force. He was willing to become a son-in-law that married into his wife's family, only because of that favor he owed the little girl who gave him that sweet. When I take your hand in mine, nobody in this world will ever dare to bully you again.

### Billionaire God of War novel Trailer:

Donghai City, International Airport.

"Hurry up!"

"Faster!"

A few dozen men in black suits rushed out of the exits, each one with an extremely serious face, as if they were going against a formidable enemy.

All the passengers in the airport quickly made way for them, not knowing who could have caused such a commotion.

The leader of the men in suits frowned deeply, then suddenly turned and left as if he had suddenly thought of something.

Soon they reached the pavement outside the airport.

Jiang Ning was sitting on a long bench, slowly blowing cigarette smoke out from his mouth.

"Master hopes you can go back, he misses you very much," the leader respectfully addressed Jiang Ning as he stood about five steps behind him.

In front of other people, this leader was of high standing, and nobody dared to go against him.

But in front of this young man in front of him, he felt extremely lowly!

"He misses me?"

Jiang Ning turned slightly and there was a smirk on his face. "Does his miss my influence? Or my money?"

If someone else had said something like that, this leader would have despised him. How could the rich and powerful Jiang family from the city of Jingdu ever covet anybody else's power and money?

But the man in front of him was different.

He was the sole heir of the Jiang family!

What made this leader even more shocked was that he was known as the War God of the East, with immense capabilities and jaw dropping wealth!

"When he chased me out of the family and married that vixen fifteen years ago, Jiang Ning had died."

Jiang Ning exhaled his last mouthful of smoke, "Jiang Ning now has nothing to do with that Jiang family back in Jingdu."

He got up to leave.

"Don't send people after me anymore. Otherwise I'll kill each one you send!"

His terrifying murderous aura immediately wrapped itself round the leader.

The leader was only able to relax his clenched fists after he saw Jiang Ning disappear into the distance.

His back was already all wet with perspiration.

He was actually nervous in front of Jiang Ning.

There was a car ready at the airport carpark.

Jiang Ning hopped in and immediately made a call.

"Fei, have you arranged everything already?"

A voice came through from the other side.

"Give me the address."

Jiang Ning immediate hung up. He held a crinkled sweet wrapper in his hand and his thoughts floated back to fifteen years ago.

He was fifteen, chased out of the Jiang house and roamed the streets.

He was cold and hungry when a simply dressed little girl gave her only sweet to Jiang Ning.
