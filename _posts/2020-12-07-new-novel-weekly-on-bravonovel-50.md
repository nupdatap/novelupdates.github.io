## 1. [Forgotten Embers](https://www.bravonovel.com/forgotten-embers-7666)

Author: Ryoshi LeCrosse

### Forgotten Embers novel Trailer:

She peddled her bicycle through the driving rain outside the city, through the streaming plains of water and soft, muddied ground. Her clothes were drenched. She entered into a wooded area which covered her, providing some small patch of relief from the rain but not her tears. She continued steering through the scattered trees, breaking through into a large clearing as the rain began again to hit her face. She felt her feet slip, losing contact with the peddles as she rode. She lost her balance and fell, tumbling from the bicycle to the muddied ground below her. The bicycle continued on beside her, sliding down the slight decline and tipping over, quickly falling on its side. She sighed and closed her eyes, laying with her sorrows there in the middle of the grassy field. She laid flat on her back in the middle of the sea of green, the raindrops falling gently down upon her face, the clear water of cleansing coating the brown hue of her delicate skin with a glossy, wet shine as she breathed in the sweet air which accompanies a freshly fallen rain, so thick it was almost tangible. She would have smiled had her heart not hurt so badly. It was quiet there apart from the rain, but rain had always been calming to her, and she had needed desperately to get away. She opened her eyes and thought she felt a tear fall from her eye as it streamed down her face, warmer than the drops of water plummeting from the clouded sky. She breathed, beginning to calm, on her face a near perfect expression of peace, and a flash of hope could be glimpsed in her blue-green eyes, deep as the oceans.

A newness of life came as she turned her head, touching her cheek to the well wet grass. She glimpsed a structure in the distance as she prepared herself to rise. Far across the grassy clearing, tucked in near the line of trees and thick shrubs the forest bears and wears as its own illustrious garment, each uniquely and painstakingly woven, there was a building in the midst of it. She raised her head with interest, and her dark hair, shoulder length and tightly curled, spread out behind her, now drenched and heavy with an early summer rain. She lifted herself up off of the damp and muddied ground, captivated by this strange rectangular structure.

She moved slowly forward, beginning to examine its form. There were grand stairs to a broad entrance and a large dome on the roof of the center of it. She was transfixed by this strange aberration as she reached for her fallen bicycle, setting it upright, and taking hold of the handlebars. As she walked, she began to run with it, until at last she hopped up and mounted it again. She pleasantly rode the light downward slope toward this new found point of interest, unable to shake the feeling that the atmosphere had changed. Whatever it was that drew her to this place, it drew her more and more emphatically the nearer came, pulling at her core with ever increasing intensity of implicit necessity.

It was an old stone structure, immaculate but for its mild decay and the vines which gripped it. The smooth stone of the building seemed almost polished under the influence of the cold and driving rain. The vines which loosely gripped the structure, the leaves which climbed the sandy walls trembled and bent with the weight of the tiny silver droplets.

'How could it be that this is here? If this is the ruins, the city was destroyed by fire, but this seems almost... untouched.'

Being within several paces of it, she left her bicycle and curiously drew near to examine the walls. From this distance, she could see the wear on the old stone which was not readily visible from afar. She placed her hand upon the rock and traced over the scars in the weathered stone.

"What is this?" she breathed.

## 2. [Fake memories](https://www.bravonovel.com/fake-memories-7673)

Author: Lyn

### Fake memories novel Synopsis:

Martie's husband, Dusty Rhodes, tries to help his brother Skeet, by providing employment in his painting business. Skeet had been in Drug rehabilitation previously, and when he first appears in the story, he is high and tries to commit suicide by jumping off a roof.

### Fake memories novel Trailer:

On that Tuesday in January, when her life changed forever, Martine Rhodes woke with a headache, developed a sour stomach after washing down two aspirin with grapefruit juice, guaranteed herself an epic bad-hair day by mistakenly using Dustin’s shampoo instead of her own, broke a fingernail, burnt her toast, discovered ants swarming through the cabinet under the kitchen sink, eradicated the pests by firing a spray can of insecticide as ferociously as Sigourney Weaver wielded a flamethrower in one of those old extraterrestrial-bug movies, cleaned up the resultant carnage with paper towels, hummed Bach’s Requiem as she solemnly consigned the tiny bodies to the trash can, and took a telephone call from her mother, Sabrina, who still prayed for the collapse of Martie’s marriage three years after the wedding. Throughout, she remained upbeat—even enthusiastic— about the day ahead, because from her late father, Robert “Smilin’ Bob” Woodhouse, she had inherited an optimistic nature, formidable coping skills, and a deep love of life in addition to blue eyes, ink-black hair, and ugly toes.

Thanks, Daddy.

After convincing her ever hopeful mother that the Rhodes marriage remained happy, Martie slipped into a leather jacket and took her golden retriever, Valet, on his morning walk. Step by step, her headache faded.

Along the whetstone of clear eastern sky, the sun sharpened

scalpels of light. Out of the west, however, a cool onshore breeze pushed malignant masses of dark clouds.

The dog regarded the heavens with concern, sniffed the air warily, and pricked his pendant ears at the hiss-clatter of palm fronds stirred by the wind. Clearly, Valet knew a storm was coming.

He was a gentle, playful dog. Loud noises frightened him, however, as though he had been a soldier in a former life and was haunted by memories of battlefields blasted by cannon fire.

Fortunately for him, rotten weather in southern California was seldom accompanied by thunder. Usually, rain fell unannounced, hissing on the streets, whispering through the foliage, and these were sounds that even Valet found soothing.

Most mornings, Martie walked the dog for an hour, along the narrow tree-lined streets of Corona Del Mar, but she had a special obligation every Tuesday and Thursday that limited their excursion to fifteen minutes on those days. Valet seemed to have a calendar in his furry head, because on their Tuesday and Thursday expeditions, he never dawdled, finishing his toilet close to home.

This morning, only one block from their house, on the grassy sward between the sidewalk and the curb, the pooch looked around shyly, discreetly lifted his right leg, and as usual made water as though embarrassed by the lack of privacy.

Less than a block farther, he was preparing to conclude the second half of his morning business when a passing garbage truck backfired, startling him. He huddled behind a queen palm, peering cautiously around one side of the tree bole and then around the other, convinced that the terrifying vehicle would reappear.

“No problem,” Martie assured him. “The big bad truck is gone. Everything’s fine. This is now a safe-to-poop zone.”

Valet was unconvinced. He remained wary.

## 3. [He will ruin me](https://www.bravonovel.com/he-will-ruin-me-7671)

Author: Lyn

### He will ruin me novel Synopsis:

The man Celine believed would change her life. Until he became her ruin…. On the hunt for evidence that will force the police to reopen the case, Maggie uncovers more than she bargained for about Celine's private life—and inadvertently puts herself on the radar of a killer.

### He will ruin me novel Trailer:

Maggie

November 30, 2015

The afternoon sun beams through the narrow window, casting a warm glow over Celine’s floral comforter.

It would be inviting, only her body was found in this very bed just thirteen days ago.

“Maggie?”

“Yeah,” I respond without actually turning around, my gaze taking in the cramped bedroom before me. I’ve never been a fan of New York City and all its overpriced boroughs. Too big, too busy, too pretentious. Take this Lower East Side apartment, for example, on the third floor of a drafty building built in the 1800s, with a ladder of shaky fire escapes facing the side alley and a kitschy gelato café downstairs. It costs more per month than the average American hands the bank in mortgage payments.

And Celine adored it.

“I’m in 410 if you just . . . want to come and find me.”

I finally turn and acknowledge the building super—a chestnut-haired English guy around thirty by my guess, with a layer of scruff over his jawline and faded blue jeans—edging toward the door. Given the apartment is 475 square feet, it doesn’t take him long to reach it.

I think he gave me his name but I wasn’t listening. I’ve barely said two words since I met him in front of Celine’s apartment, armed with a stack of cardboard flats and trash bags. An orchestra of clocks that softly tick away claim that that was nearly half an hour ago. I’ve simply stood here since then, feeling the brick-exposed walls—lined with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and filled with the impressive collection of treasures that Celine had amassed over her twenty-eight years—closing in on me.

But now I feel the need to speak. “You were the one who let the police in?” Celine never missed work, never arrived late. That’s why, after not showing up for two days and not answering her phone or her door, her coworker finally called the cops.

The super nods.

“You saw her?”

His eyes flicker to the thin wall that divides the bedroom from the rest of the apartment—its only purpose is to allow the building’s owner to charge rent for a “one-bedroom” instead of a studio. There’s not even enough room for a door. Yes, he saw her body. “She seemed really nice,” he offers, his throat turning scratchy, shifting on his feet. He’d rather be unplugging a shit-filled toilet than be here right now. I don’t blame him. “Uh . . . So you can just slide the key through the mail slot in my door when you’re finished, if you want? I’ll be home later tonight to grab it.”

Under different circumstances, I’d find his accent charming. “I’ll be staying here for a while.”

### My Sweet Love, My Cuddly Baby novel Trailer:

As soon as Lin Qingqing came out from the training room, she receives a phone call from Xiang Huayang, the voice from the other end of the phone was as low and pleasant as usual. "You will have a competition tomorrow. Are you nervous?"

Receiving his phone call, she was happy. Lin Qingqing laughed, and her face was filled with happiness. "Not nervous. When the competition is over, remember to treat me a meal."

Xiang Huayang seemed to have some helpless smile, he had always been aloof in his smile but it contained a kind of doting. "Rest assured, I won’t neglect you." After he finished, he stopped for a moment and then added in a straight tone. "Qingqing, let's have a good talk when the competition is over."

His sudden straight tone made Lin Qingqing nervous, but she pretended to be natural and asked. "Why, what do you want to talk to me about?"

He just replied. "Wait until your competition is over."

Lin Qingqing made a cut off the sound. She had already walked to the dormitory door. From afar, she saw a person standing downstairs. Lin Qingqing recognized Liang Xin. She rushed Xiang Huayang and replied. "Xinxin has come to see me. I'll hang up first."

Silent for a moment, he replied. "Okay, good luck with your competition tomorrow."

Liang Xin came up to her. Lin Qingqing hung up the phone call and greeted her with a smile. Liang Xin held a cat-like flannel doll and handed it to her. She walked over. "This lucky doll is for you, remember hold it in your arm while sleeping today and the competition tomorrow will be a pass."

Taking it over, Lin Qingqing deliberately looked at the puppet before replying. "It doesn't look very good. I will reluctantly accept it."

Liang Xin snorted. "I think you can do it, you still have a mood to make a joke. I won't worry about your competition tomorrow. En, then I won't accompany you tomorrow."

Lin Qingqing immediately replied. "No, no, you still have to accompany me. I have confidence only when you support me." She slapped herself on the mouth and added. "My mouth is full of nonsense. This cat is cute and adorable."

Covering her mouth, Liang Xin burst into laughter.

## 5. [BlackMail](https://www.bravonovel.com/blackmail-7656)

Author: MisterE05

### BlackMail novel Synopsis:

"Send the money or I'll post them." Was a threat Anna had to deal with 4 times until now, all because she wanted some love. But, her fate changed when a heavy weight boxer happened to walk by in a rather uncomfortable scene, apparently he has some unique abilities and killed the blackmailer. She didn't know how to thank him, he didn't want anything in return. She got to know a bit more of his secrets, and is now pledged to pay him back by keeping his secret with her until death shall reach...

### BlackMail novel Trailer:

10:56pm/21.09.2019/London, United Kingdom.

"Did you bring the money?" Whispered a voice in the shadows as soon as Anna entered this dark alleyway and looked for him.

The dark shade of the night is covering his torso, only his legs are to be seen. 

Holding the burden in her heart, trying her best to sink down her emotions, she faces the blackmailer.

This trauma has been going on for a rather long time now, her heart shattered due to this backstab coming from someone so important to her.

She doesn't feel capable of picking up the pieces and shape it whole again.

Answering with a low tone suppressing emotion, Anna cites. "Yes yes. How many times do I need to bring you money until you disappear forever?"

After that sentence, a tear forced out from her eye even though she didn't want it too.

This sure has been an emotionally tiring situation and to say such a sentence to someone of which she planned to grow old with? What a shame.

The reply from the blackmailer standing seemingly 6 foot tall in the shadows is a little bit long, but no doubt swift as he wants to get this over with before anyone catches them. "Just shut the hell up and give the money, or else I'll tap this button right here."

He lifts his smartphone and shows a strongly inappropriate picture of her and threatens under a thicker but yet weaseling tone. "And the entire internet will see these amazing pictures. I'd like to be there and see how everyone you know reacts to this sort of shame."

Another tear fell from her eye, then the other and then the next. Let's just say that a freak accident left her with one functioning eye as a result, the left one has been surgically removed.

Trying to convince him to stop robbing her out of money, Anna explains a burden. "But I'm getting into debt everywhere! Friends, family, coworkers, bank. I can't keep borrowing money and I can't keep lying to people. Ple...."

Out of a sudden, her sentence was roughly interrupted a split second before it reached an end. 

Of course she  was interrupted from the blackmailer trying his best not to yell, whispering under a harshly projected tone. "Look I don't give a damn about your life and just want the money, do you have it or not?"

"To think, we could have had a long happy life together." Her nose started getting red because of the overall sad and traumatic situation. 

A situation in which she was forced to face for the fourth time now because of this same retard of a person, she feels worn out.

Worn out mentally, emotionally and financially so she asks. "Why did you scoop so low?"
