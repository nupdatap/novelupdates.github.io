### *The Most Sought-After Man* Preview

"Ma'am, I don't want to work hard anymore..." 

Lin Fan edited this message and sent it out as mass texts. 

In his eyes, a deeply complicated emotion emerged. 

It's been three years. 

To repay his gratitude, he returned from the Dark World and married into The Bai family for three years. In the past three years, he had suffered from contemptuous look and mockery from the people around him because he had no money, no power, nor an occupation. 

He had been slaving away for the Bai family like a bull working on a field, where scoldings or beatings were his usual treatments. Lin Fan, who was the former Dark Emperor, had had enough. 

And now, he has finally made this difficult decision. 

Ding! Ding! Ding! 

At this moment, came the consecutive ringing of notifications from text messages. 

Lin Fan turned on his cellphone and immediately saw one after another messages appearing on the screen.

Madam Luolin in commerce, "Fan, I have finally seen the day where you uttered these words. From now on, the eight oil fields under the Global Group will be placed under your assets. Also, the Global Group will transfer 51 percent of the shares, without any condition, to your name. You will become the new chairman and the actual shareholder of the Global Group. All properties and personnel of the Global Group are at your disposal. You can make decisions without notifying the Group."

Madam Meigui from the Underground, "Fan, you have finally made this decision! Us folks from the Blood Prison are waiting for your majestic return. We have waited for far too long. I will immediately inform the Yanhuang branch and you shall become king of Yanhuang branch of the Underground!"

Madam Nihuang of the military force, "Kid, you finally got it straight! No point being a live-in son-in-law. It is better to be the warlord of the military force. Starting today, the Yanhuang military force will grant you the title of Commander of the Yanhuang military force! From now on, you are Lin Zuo (TN\* Zuo is a prestigious title usually given to someone who holds high office in the military)! The Commander of the Yanhuang military force!"

"…"

The contents of these messages were definitely enough to astound the world but Lin Fan just nodded his head after reading them, showing no signs of surprises. 

Instead, there was a hint of deep and complicated emotion in his eyes, "It's been three years. Originally, I just wanted to repay the life-saving grace of that little girl and her steamed bun from back then! But the cruel reality and people's snobbery have left me no choice but to become the Dark Emperor again!"

Phew! 

Lin Fan gently blew out a smoke ring. As a bit of smoke curled and lingered in the air, a skeletal pattern was formed before it slowly dissipated. 

This made Lin Fan seemed unusually mysterious and strange at this moment. 

It was in this instant, right when the cigarette butt in his hand was just thrown onto the ground, a berating shout was heard coming from the villa behind him, "Lin Fan, where the heck did you scram to again? Come quick and help us drain the water from the feet washing!"

Upon hearing this, Lin Fan's body stiffened, and a relishing smile gradually appeared on the corner of his mouth. 

At that moment, he stomped on the cigarette butts with calm elegance and walked slowly into the villa. 

He immediately saw his mother-in-law, Shen Yumei, and his wife, Bai Yi sitting on the sofa, looking like they had just finished soaking their feet. 

As she saw Lin Fan walked in, Mrs. Shen Yumei suddenly seemed like a cat that had just seen a mouse, spiking up all her hair and berating in anger, "Hmph! You worthless piece of crap. How dare you went out to slack off. The floor isn't mopped. The laundry isn't done. What do we, The Bai family even raise and keep a worthless crap like you for?"

"Hurry up, drain the water from our feet washing pails!"

Lin Fan had long been accustomed to the terrible attitude of his mother-in-law, Shen Yumei. His face was surprisingly calm as he picked up two pails of water, and walked towards the washroom. 

Good-for-nothing! 

Coward! 

Looking at her husband's pitiful appearance, his wife, Bai Yi couldn't help but feel bad. She felt the need to help Lin Fan with a rebuttal. 

Before the words even reached her lips, a piece of breaking news suddenly appeared on the TV screen with a resounding noise. 

"We interrupt this program to bring you breaking news: According to the latest news from the United States of America, Global Group, which controls 70 percent of the global economy, officially announced that the eight oil fields it had just acquired last month, will be transferred to a youth with no accompanying condition."

"In addition, 51 percent of the company's stocks were also given to said youth for free."
