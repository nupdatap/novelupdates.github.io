### *The Poorest Rich Man* Trailer

Time: 9 p.m. Place: University, boy’s dormitory

"Chen Hao, go to room 101 on the first floor and bring me my laptop!"

A guy with blond hair from the dormitory next door kicked Chen Hao's door open. After dropping off a buck, he tucked his hand into his pockets and proceeded back to his room.

"By the way, Chen Hao, do stop by the supermarket downstairs and grab me a bottle of mineral water while you’re at it!"

The blonde-hair guy turned around and threw another three bucks on the ground. Two bucks were for the water, and the other was Chen Hao’s errand fee.

"Hey Blondie, why do the people from your dormitory always ask Chen Hao to run errands for you? Isn’t that bullying?"

The people in Chen Hao's dormitory asked with a straight face as they could not stand it anymore.

"Oh! Dear Chen Hao’s roommates, haven't you all noticed? He’s willing to do anything for money! "

Blondie said with a sarcastic tone and left with a smirk on his face.

Chen Hao’s face flushed as he ignored the snarky comments.

He stooped and picked up the few banknotes from the ground. He secretly thought, This way, I’ve earned two bucks. That’s enough for me to buy three steamed bread and a bag of salted vegetables, so I won’t starve any more!

"Chen Hao... Don't go. If you don’t have any money, we’ll lend it to you. You don't have to pay it back!" said the dorm leader, sympathetically.

Chen Hao smiled bitterly and shook his head, "Thank you..."

He turned around and headed out.

The people in the dorm gazed at Chen Hao's figure from behind and shook their heads with pity.

The truth was, Chen Hao didn’t want to be an errand boy. He, too, wished to spend his days happily in the university, just like everyone else.

However, he was lucky enough to even study at a university.

He was extremely poor!

His roommates were very nice to him. But the more they helped, the less he wanted their help. Otherwise, no matter how strong their friendship was, there would eventually be a gap between them.

Apart from his roommates, Chen Hao had almost nothing in the university!

"Chen Hao, I heard Blondie said that you’re going downstairs."

An elegantly dressed student came out of the dormitory next door.

His name was Xu Nan, the leader of Blondie's dormitory. His family ran a factory. He was rich, tall and handsome, and was hugely popular among the females.

Yet, he had always looked down on Chen Hao. Even on a good day, he would not look Chen Hao in the eye.
Chen Hao had no idea why he called him.

Chen Hao nodded, "Yes, I’m going down!"

Xu Nan smiled nonchalantly. He took out a box of Du*** from his pocket and threw it at Chen Hao.
"Perfect timing. A friend of mine has some business in the East woods today. Go and deliver this to him. Here, ten bucks for you!"

Xu Nan was a playboy and he had asked a lot of girls out.

He also had much riffraff.

Chen Hao didn't give it a second thought. He was just looking to earn a few extra bucks.

Chen Hao took it and headed for the stairs. As he turned his back, he seemed to hear Xu Nan's laughter coming from behind.

Chen Hao went downstairs. He planned to drop off the condom first, then grab Blondie's computer and mineral water on his way back.

Chen Hao knew all about the small woods outside the campus. It was a beautiful location notoriously known as the concentration camp for ‘open-air activities’.

In no time, Chen Hao arrived at the place that Xu Nan mentioned.

At a glance, he saw a man and a woman sitting on the promenade in the woods, talking and laughing.
Under the moonlight, Chen Hao saw their faces distinctly.

His whole body trembled!

It was Yang Xia!
